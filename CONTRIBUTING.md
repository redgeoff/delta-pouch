Testing
----

### In Node

This will run the tests in Node:

    npm run node-test

You can also check for 100% code coverage using:

    npm run node-full-test

Run single test

    npm run node-test test/index.js -- -- -g '<regex>'


### In the browser

    $ npm run browser-server
    Use any browser to visit http://127.0.0.1:8001/index.html
    And you can filter the tests, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8001/index.html?grep=reg-ex


## Automated browser tests

Testing in headless Chrome:

Note: you must have Chrome installed

    $ npm run browser-test

You can also filter the tests, e.g.

    $ npm run browser-test -- -g 'some reg-ex'

Firefox:

Note: you must have Firefox installed

    $ npm run browser-test -- -b selenium:firefox

To test in headless Chrome, generate code coverage and check for 100% coverage:

    $ npm run browser-coverage-full-test

You can then view the test coverage by opening cache/coverage/browser/lcov-report/index.html in any browser
